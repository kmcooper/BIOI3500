# Directions:
# 1. Go to https://jupyter.org/try
# 2. Click 'Try classic notebook'
# 3. Open the Douglas County Dashboard: https://dogis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html
# 4. Copy the code below into your notebook and add the DC positives
# 5. Run the code. Is the trend increasing or decreasing?

# Cases in Douglas County
# May 24 to June 7
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]
#positives = [put the numbers for Douglas county starting May 24 and ending June 7 here]

plt.scatter(days,positives)

z = np.polyfit(days, positives, 1)
p = np.poly1d(z) 
plt.plot(days,p(days),"r--")

plt.show()

# If the first value from p is negative, the numbers are falling
# If the first value from p is 0, the numbers are staying the same
# If the first value from p is positive, the numbers are rising
p


# Cases in Nebraska
# May 24 to June 7
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14]
#positives = [put the numbers for Nebraska starting May 24 and ending June 7 here]

plt.scatter(days,positives)

z = np.polyfit(days, positives, 1)
p = np.poly1d(z) 
plt.plot(days,p(days),"r--")

plt.show()

# If the first value from p is negative, the numbers are falling
# If the first value from p is 0, the numbers are staying the same
# If the first value from p is positive, the numbers are rising
